# Quickstart Guide

This guide will get you from zero to a running AI agent in under 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 23+
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) package manager
- Git
- Ollama or an API key from Openrouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required to run alanOS.

### 1. Install alanOS CLI

```bash
bun install -g @alanos/cli
```

### 2. Create Your First Project

```bash
alanos create my-agent
cd my-agent
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key

Your new project includes a `.env.example` file. You need to copy it to a new `.env` file to store your secret API keys.

```bash
# Copy the environment template to a new .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Open the file for editing
alanos env edit-local

# Add either OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Your agent will not work without an API key. For more details on environment configuration, see the [Environment Guide](./cli/env.md).

### 4. Start Your Agent

```bash
alanos start
```

Your agent is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Next?

Congratulations, you have a running alanOS agent! Here's where to go next to explore its full power:

- **[Explore all CLI Commands](./cli/overview.md)**: See everything you can do from the command line, including managing agents and plugins.
- **[Customize Your Agent](./core/characters.md)**: Learn how to edit your agent's personality, knowledge, and abilities using Character Files.
- **[Understand the Project Structure](./core/project.md)**: Get a detailed breakdown of every file in your new project.
- **[Extend Your Agent with Plugins](./core/plugins.md)**: Discover how to add new capabilities to your agent.

> **Important Note**: Your agent includes the `@alanos/plugin-bootstrap` plugin by default, which is **essential for communication**. This plugin handles all message processing, response generation, and platform interactions. Without it, your agent won't be able to respond to messages. Only remove it if you're building a completely custom event handling system.
